	<p>
		Welcome to my website! I'm a  grammer-checking, sass-queen, aspiring author. Currently I'm trying to get an English degree to do all that, which sounds way less cool then the first description. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I currently specialize in quickly counting money, walk-running on wet floors while blancing many things in my hands, and talking to people in a jumbled combonation of spanish-japanese-english (which is funny, because I only learned french in high school)!
	</p>

	<p> 
	Okay, yes. I'm a waitress/host at a Japanese Steakhouse.
	</p>

	<p>
	Yay college life and always being tired!
	</p>
